## Course Description
This class will cover many of the latest developments in groundwater-flow modeling in the following topical areas:  new and enhanced capabilities for modeling groundwater flow with MODFLOW 6; solute transport with MT3D-USGS;  groundwater/watershed interactions with GSFLOW and MODSIM, and parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis using PEST++. Most of the class will be taught using Flopy and Jupyter Notebooks.  In addition to lectures on the latest developments, most sessions will include in-class exercises to give attendees a better understanding of how to use the modeling tools.

## Overview
* Monday: Python Basics, Flopy, PEST++
* Tuesday: PEST++, MODFLOW 6
* Wednesday: MODFLOW 6
* Thursday: MODFLOW 6, GSFLOW
* Friday: GSFLOW, MODSIM, MT3D-USGS
