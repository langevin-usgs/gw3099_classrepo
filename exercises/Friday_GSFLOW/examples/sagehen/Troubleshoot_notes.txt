If getting the following error then you need to add 'python' in your envrionmental variables.  

			error: 'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

To enter the path for python to your environmental variables go to:

control panel > system > advanced > |Environmental Variables| > system variables -> Path                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                            
The path needs to include: C:\Python26; (or equivalent).
                                                                                                                                                                            
Then restart your command file prompt, and try typing 'python'.

The other option is to remove the 'python' from each command line in the batch file. 

This has been done for the alternate batch file called 'runscripts_python_removed.bat.


If there are lakes present in a model then then 'nlakes' and 'nlake_hrus' need to be 
set to 'calculated' in the file prms_dimensions.csv

If this is not done correctly then the following error occurs:

			[int(row[1]) for row in s_cursor if int(row[1]) > 0]))                                                                                   
			ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence
