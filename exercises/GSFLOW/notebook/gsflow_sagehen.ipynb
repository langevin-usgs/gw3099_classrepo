    "Requires Python 2.7 or newer, ArcMap, and the data/python scripts provided in the develop branch of the repository located here: https://github.com/gsflow/gsflow-arcpy. Documentation can be found in the tutorial file called gsflow_arcpy_tutorial.pdf located in the gsflow-arcpy repository. \n",

This is an important feature of the scripts because GSFLOW simulates SW-GW interaction using the stream depth and groundwater head. If the streams are generated at the 10 m DEM then streams can be shifted relative to the stream canyons represented by the model grid scale altitudes (90 m DEM).

CRT can develop cascades as 4-way (cell faces) or 8-way (cell faces and diagonals), and in this case we are using the 8-way option. The assumption is that the watershed slopes are steep enough to assume the water surface slope is equal to land surface slope, which is often a reasonable approximation. Note, this is the same approximation made in the SFR Package. Thus, if there is water stored on the surface or in the gravity storage reservoir of the soil zone then water will be routed according to the directions defined by the cascade paths.\n",

    "Daily climate for each grid cell/HRU is required for GSFLOW. A good approach for generating daily climate for each cell/HRU in the model is to rely in climate stations for the daily values (Tmin, Tmax, and PPT). Monthly average spatial adjustment factors are then used to distribute the climate station data to all cells/HRUs. For temperature, either the Temp_1sta or Temp_lapse module is used. For Temp_1sta, temperature adjustment factors by month and cell/HRU are calculating using the monthly PRISM 30-year normals; for Temp_lapse, two climate stations are used to distribute temperatures according to altitude. The latter approach is preferred if there is a low and high altitude station within or near the subbasin. The default approach for the prism_parameters.py script is Temp_1sta, and this can be changed to Temp_lapse in the configuration (.ini) file. Similarly, the Precip_1sta module is default and spatial adjustment factors are calculated using the monthly PRISM 30-year normals.\n",
